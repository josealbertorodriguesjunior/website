Public Docker images, Debian packages, or just about any kind of file, for common infrastructure or for your applications are distributable via P2P file sharing across peers. Subutai's Kurjun repository let's you publically publish, or privately share files using global or exclusive swarms respectively.<br> The verified site and content hosting service built into the Hub allows for safe content distribution across peers dynamically based on where on the Internet that data is needed most.<br> Currently we're researching ways to go a step further. We would like to go to the next level. We have been looking at providing generalized content distritubtion in the form of a file system. We are investigating the integration of various file systems which could adapt well to the P2P model like the Interplanetary File System (IPFS)."

We already enable sharing threat information and offer dynamic sharing to provide defensive capabilities against DDoS. SS has built in analytics to detect fraud and cyber threats. The SS Hub offers additional free services to enhance the analytics and diagnostics needed to detect bottlenecks and threats. Subutai running on acclerated routers also assist in detection and counter measures. However in the future we would like to take a big step in cyber security: we are working on a legal framework and protocol to enable offensive capabilities to defend against attackers to make the Internet a safer place."

Users of Subutai can create cloud environments effectively appearing as virtual data centers. The more computing resources you throw into your peer[s] and the number of peers supporting your environment the bigger the virtual data center. Scaling a peer with more resources and scaling the number of peers themselves give Subutai it's elastic cloud capabilities. Higher level infrastructure services are built on this such as an S3 compatible clone. Subutai aims to model and implement as many Amazon compatible services as possible."

Not only do you tie people and SOHO offices together, but you enable them with common back office and productivity applications they need. Native built in social cloud services and the AppScale based PaaS layer can be utilized to quickly build your next ultimate application on Subutai."

We think such a system could especially benefit those students in universities around the world that lack budgets to have everything on hand."
