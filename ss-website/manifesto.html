    <h1>Subutai Manifesto</h1>
    <p>
      Using Subutai, we are barbarian hordes knocking on the doors of the establishment that tries to control and
      monitor our systems, harvest our activities, and track our relations. We are sick and tired of vendor lock-in, and
      unpleasant end-of-the-month surprises from the big cloud providers. We do not want to be beholden to institutions,
      corporations or foreign governments’ laws. We do not want to be at the mercy of hackers or closed source
      commercial software with backdoors. We want a safe and productive existence on the greatest digital silk road, the
      Internet, which should empower us all, even those trying to make a buck.</p>

    <p>Collectively strengthened with open technologies including Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cloud Computing, and Blockchain,
      the horde possesses enough resources to surpass the power of a million Amazons and Googles while decentralizing
      control. We are all “Dogs of War”. We are ready to do battle for our independence and our privacy. Become one of
      us, come join us as we make plans to dominate the world in the <a href="https://hub.subut.ai/">War Room</a>.

            <p>History shows us that great power can be unleashed by meritocracy, tolerance, and sharing.
              The decision by Genghis Khan to depart from Mongol tradition and make a non-Mongol slave, Subutai, the
              General of his armies gave birth to the largest empire in all of human history.
              The hordes were given first rights to the plunder of every campaign instead of it being hoarded by a
              single individual.
              The Khan shared the spoils of war. No matter how inhuman, and brutal they were to their enemies in battle,
              once conquered all who joined the horde enjoyed religious, and ethnic tolerance with the very same rules
              of meritocracy that allowed a slave to become the greatest general ever in history.
              Without these principles the tiny fraction of the population who were ethnic Mongols would never have been
              able to conquer as much as they did.</p>

            <div style="margin: 5px 0px">

              <div class="disclaimer pop">
                  <h4 style="text-decoration: underline">Note: Disclaimer</h4>
                  <p>None of us are Mongolian, in fact, all of the Asian members of our team probably had their
                    ancestors literally brutalized <a
                        href="https://www.nature.com/news/genghis-khan-s-genetic-legacy-has-competition-1.16767">by
                      Genghis Khan</a>.
                    We don’t care about stuff that happened a thousand years ago. Bottom line, this guy was the
                    greatest <a href="http://azdictionary.co/bamf/123662/3/">BAMF</a> of all time. His empire’s
                    horsemen epitomized the unstoppable warrior spirit of the times that rampaged through all of
                    Asia.
                    We like the epic notions that epoch inspires. So we did not select the name for any ethnic
                    reasons. Subutai was an amazing figure and story. If we can live with that, so can everyone
                    else.
                    If you’re a creme puff offended by that, sorry, but we can’t change our spirit to accommodate
                    your
                    sensitivity.</p>

                  <p>However to be respectful, even to ourselves, we do recognize that the Mongol empire under
                    Genghis
                    Khan did some very atrocious things. In no way, shape, or form do we condone them. They
                    tragically
                    killed and ruined millions of lives at the time. Until the conquered were subjugated and
                    assimilated they were brutalized. Those who did not submit were completely wiped off the face of
                    the earth. They destroyed entire civilizations. We consciously do not honor the brutality as the
                    reason for their success. We think it was the opposite, or rather the contrast between being an
                    opponent versus an ally accepted after a good fight with the benefits of sharing, tolerance, and
                    meritocracy that unleashed their power to conquer all of Asia.</p>

                <p><a class="close" href="/">Close</a></p>

            </div>
            
            <p>We chose Subutai, this slave that became the world’s greatest general, as our project’s namesake. We
              believe his life and achievements epitomize the results of our common principles: meritocracy, tolerance,
              and sharing. No one is entitled by merely existing as a part of a mass. You must earn your place through
              battle. We’ve seen many projects suffer and die because meritocracies turn into lame democracies. Talkers,
              politician types, infiltrate to benefit from their status in the project rather than contributing to its
              success. When the numbers of these types grow they turn the project into a septic where no honorable
              warrior
              spirit in search of conquest enjoys participating anymore. We will have none of that. We all share in the
              plunder based on meritocracy while being tolerant of everyone regardless of race, religion, or sexual
              orientation of any kind.</p>

            <p>These principles do not only apply to Subutai’s governance rules, and community culture but to its
              flagship
              open source product. The nature of the product feeds back into these core principles to strengthen and
              expand the community. Subutai empowers the horde by allowing anyone to securely share idle computer
              resources across the Internet with other participants. With Subutai, friends, family, colleagues, and even
              companies can create their own private data centers (infrastructure clouds). They can even buy and sell
              resources using Subutai’s Goodwill and KHAN cryptocurrency tokens. Software and applications install and
              run
              on Linux hosts (containers) in the virtual data center’s private network. Cloud owners pay for resources
              as
              their container hosts consume them: it’s the Container-as-a-Service (CaaS) model with hourly billing
              between
              parties.</p>

            <p>Attacking one of us will be like attacking all of us. The horde’s collective defense system will allow
              all
              participants to counter-attack when any other members are attacked. Governments are not doing anything
              significant to protect us online while using our own tax dollars to invade our privacy. It’s time we took
              matters into our own hands. With a little computation and bandwidth from each of the millions of
              participants, we will have the ability to aggregate enough firepower to blow attackers off the Internet,
              and
              burn their operation down to the ground. Don’t mess with us! We fight back!</p>

            <p>Still, the great Khan respected, some say loved strong opponents. He specifically invited past enemies
              that
              fought valiantly into the fold of the empire. Subutai incentivises hackers to do good through rewards and
              bounty programs. Why? Because they are bad asses like us. Respect! Why steal when you can just get
              rewarded
              for doing what you do best? Subutai helps make black hackers into white hackers to help protect the
              KHAN.</p>

            <p>We are lunatics, so we did not stop at software. We want to be epic or die trying. No one here wants to
              be
              a puppet subordinating to the man. So we built a broadband router and IoT gateway that mines for KHAN
              cryptocurrency (hence it is also a physical wallet) called the Subutai Liquid Router. We want everyone to
              participate, not just us geeks. Everyone that helps should share in the plunder. We knew a device that
              lets
              residential Internet subscribers mine coins and pays for itself in cryptocurrency would be irresistable.
              Everyone wants to participate in the cryptocurrency economy, and Subutai lets them. The router hardware is
              an accelerated plug-n-play Subutai Appliance, which lets users easily and securely share or rent resources
              on their local area network to anyone else.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvMR6FT_ql0">Booyakasha!</a> We’re not messing around.</p>

            <p>We don’t want Subutai becoming just a techie niche platform. Non-technical residential Internet users at
              home or those trying to run small businesses on a budget need to be able to fire up cloud and IoT
              applications as easily as they install iPhone apps from Apple’s App Store today. Subutai enables and
              rewards
              both users and application developers by ensuring a rich ecosystem of open source applications to
              flourish.
              Application developers can package their apps as Dockerized applications and as Google AppEngine
              applications for users to pull down from the Subutai Bazaar and run on their P2P Clouds.</p>

            <p>Open source software and hardware is very important to us. We want more and better products to benefit
              home
              users and small businesses. We created an open source contribution program where people can contribute
              resources to GitHub projects. In return for resources to test their products and run project
              infrastructure,
              open source projects create blueprints for applications. These applications are made publically available
              on
              the Subutai Bazaar for anyone to fire up on their personal cloud. Those contributing computer resources to
              open source projects get credit for their contributions and earn Goodwill on the platform to purchase
              resources from others. This is a win-win-win, a grand slam for everyone.</p>

            <p>When anyone can run cloud applications, consume, and provide cloud services in a safe and productive
              environment, a cloud sharing economy emerges, and its disruptive effects will benefit everyone by
              accelerating the race to zero. We want billions of mini-Amazons popping up all over the world. We want to
              stop the needless waste of electricity on idle computers and help the environment by requiring less power
              hungry data centers. We want clouds to be able to be efficient by running closer to user load. We want the
              Internet to be a better place for personal and business computing. Mercilessly, we want to take back the
              cloud!</p>
